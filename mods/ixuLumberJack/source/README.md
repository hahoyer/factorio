"Trees are the real Enemy" someone said about factorio.
Furthermore there are mods existing that force the player to chop huge amounts of wood before the interesting things are available.
Have you ever played the mods AmatorPhasma or Pyanodon?
Here's the cure:
A cheap lumberjack available in early game.
This mod provides a lumberjack that ...
- is available for 12 logs, so you have to chop about 3 trees - sounds acceptable, doesn't it.
- does not need research, since it uses ancient technology.
- does not need extra power source, since it comes with a small unbreakable windmill.
- includes a wooden chest that has room for 1.6k logs so you do not have to care to much for it.

It is a bit slow, but that's the price.

Now - with this mod in your toolbox you can fight the real enemy.
Now you can play wood-loving mods factorio-like: Automate everything that is annoying.
And now you are eventually able to give AmatorPhasma and Pyanodon another change.
You should do that. They are both exciting. Really!
